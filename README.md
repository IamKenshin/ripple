# ripple
The Ripple component, along with the sass styles, can be found in /src/components/ripple.
Make sure to install node-sass in order to reap the benefits of sass(scss) files.
This repo comes with a sample app that has a button and a div wrapped in Ripple components so that the Ripple component can be tested. You can wrap any React component inside of a Ripple component.
